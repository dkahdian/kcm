abstract = {Computational efficiency is a central concern in the design of knowledge representation systems. In order to obtain efficient systems, it has been suggested that one should limit the form of the statements in the knowledge base or use an incomplete inference mechanism. The former approach is often too restrictive for practical applications, whereas the latter leads to uncertainty about exactly what can and cannot be inferred from the knowledge base. We present a third alternative, in which knowledge given in a general representation language is translated (compiled) into a tractable form—allowing for efficient subsequent query answering.We show how propositional logical theories can be compiled into Horn theories that approximate the original information. The approximations bound the original theory from below and above in terms of logical strength. The procedures are extended to other tractable languages (for example, binary clauses) and to the first-order case. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of our approach by compiling concept descriptions in a general frame-based language into a tractable form.},

abstract = {We identify a new representation of propositional knowledge bases, the Sentential Decision Diagram (SDD), which is interesting for a number of reasons. First, it is canonical in the presence of additional properties that resemble reduction rules of OBDDs. Second, SDDs can be combined using any Boolean operator in polytime. Third, CNFs with n variables and treewidth w have canonical SDDs of size O(n2w), which is tighter than the bound on OBDDs based on pathwidth. Finally, every OBDD is an SDD. Hence, working with the latter does not preclude the former.},

We consider the problem of bottom-up compilation of knowledge bases, which is usually predicated on the existence of a polytime function for combining compilations using Boolean operators (usually called an Apply function). While such a polytime Apply function is known to exist for certain languages (e.g., OBDDs) and not exist for others (e.g., DNNFs), its existence for certain languages remains unknown. Among the latter is the recently introduced language of Sentential Decision Diagrams (SDDs): while a polytime Apply function exists for SDDs, it was unknown whether such a function exists for the important subset of compressed SDDs which are canonical. We resolve this open question in this paper and consider some of its theoretical and practical implications. Some of the findings we report question the common wisdom on the relationship between bottom-up compilation, language canonicity and the complexity of the Apply function. &lt;/p&gt; }, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Van den Broeck, Guy and Darwiche, Adnan}, year={2015}, month={Feb.} }

This makes SDDs a prominent representation language, with many applications in artificial intelligence and knowledge compilation. We prove that SDDs are more succinct than OBDDs also in theory, by constructing a family of boolean functions where each member has polynomial SDD size but exponential OBDD size. This exponential separation improves a quasipolynomial separation recently established by Razgon (2014), and settles an open problem in knowledge compilation (Darwiche, 2011). &lt;/p&gt; }, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Bova, Simone}, year={2016}, month={Feb.} }

abstract = {This paper deals with the number of monochromatic combinatorial rectangles required to approximate a boolean function on a constant fraction of all inputs, where each rectangle may use its own partition of the input variables. The main result of the paper is that the number of rectangles required for the approximation of boolean functions in this model is very sensitive to the allowed error. There is an explicitly defined sequence of boolean functions fn on n variables such that fn has rectangle approximations with a constant number of rectangles and one-sided error 13+o(1) or two-sided error 14+o(1), but, on the other hand, fn requires exponentially many rectangles if the error bounds are decreased by an arbitrarily small constant. As applications of this result, the following separation results for read-once branching programs are obtained. The functions from the main result require only linear size for nondeterministic read-once branching programs and randomized read-once branching programs with two-sided error 13+o(1), while randomized read-once branching programs with constant two-sided error smaller than 13 and unambiguous nondeterministic read-once branching programs require exponential size.}
