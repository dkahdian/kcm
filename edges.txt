\maketitle

This paper documents how different types of edges are formatted in the Knowledge Compilation Map.

First, consider the following two definitions. Given two languages $A$ and $B$: 
\\
\\
- $A{\leq_p}B$: There exists a poly-time transformation $T_p:A \mapsto B$"\\
- $A\cancel{\leq_p}B$ There does not exist such a poly-time transformation $T_p$.\\
- $A{\leq_q}B$: There exists a quasi-polynomial transformation $T_q:A\mapsto B$.\\
- $A\cancel{\leq_q}B$: There does not exist such a poly-time transformation $T_q$\\
\\
We may also define the following "uncertainty" relations.\\
- $A\stackrel{?}{\leq_p}B$: unknown if $T_p$ exists. \\
- $A\stackrel{?}{\leq_q}B$: unknown if $T_q$ exists. \\
\\
Every language pair $(A, B)$ can be categorized into the following classifications: \\\\
- $A{\leq_p}B$ \\
- $A\cancel{\leq_p}B$ and $A\stackrel{?}{\leq_q}B$ \\
- $A\cancel{\leq_p}B$ and $A{\leq_q}B$ \\
- $A\stackrel{?}{\leq_p}B$ and $A{\leq_q}B$ \\
- $A\stackrel{?}{\leq_p}B$ and $A\stackrel{?}{\leq_q}B$ \\
- $A\cancel{\leq_q}B$

These may be displayed respectively:\\
- Solid direct arrowhead:        $->$\\
- Dashed straight line, perpendicular to edge:    $\vdots$ as arrowhead\\
- Solid straight line:     $|$ as arrowhead\\
- Solid straight line and dashed arrowhead\\
- Only a dashed arrowhead\\
- Double solid dashed line $||$\\

Solid direct arrowheads should never point down (i.e. they should point up or flat, in case both ends are a direct arrowhead); that way, the top node is the most succinct.

Note that both ends should have an arrowhead, the shape of which depends on the actual relationship between A and B vs B and A. For example, it may be the case that $A\cancel{\leq_p}B$ and $A\stackrel{?}{\leq_q}B$ but $B\cancel{\leq_q}A$; then the nodes should properly be arranged to account for this.
